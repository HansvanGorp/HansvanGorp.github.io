A mechanism for generating output data using a generative model. The generative model comprises a plurality of score-based neural networks, each configured to generate an initial score processable, using a sampling technique, to produce an instance of example data. The initial scores are combined to define a combined score. The combined score is processed using the sampling technique to generate the output data. Each score-based neural network is trained using a different set of training data.
